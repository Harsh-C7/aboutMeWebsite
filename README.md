# aboutMeWebsite
This website has been built using two of the most fundamental web development technologies: Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

HTML provides the structure of the website, defining the various elements on the page such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms. HTML is a markup language that uses tags and attributes to define the content and layout of web pages.

CSS, on the other hand, is responsible for the styling of the website. It enables the designer to control the layout, typography, color, and other visual aspects of the website, separating the presentation from the content. CSS uses a set of rules and selectors to apply styles to HTML elements, providing a way to create visually appealing and consistent designs across multiple pages.

Together, HTML and CSS form the foundation of the vast majority of websites on the internet. They are powerful yet relatively simple technologies that allow developers to create great web experiences for users.
